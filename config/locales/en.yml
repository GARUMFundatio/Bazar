  text_por_que_bazar_parrafo: "<p>Bazar is the first program developed by Garum and it combines the traditional functions of a b2b marketplace with a social layer that allows user/business interaction beyond mere monetary transaction.</p>

        <p>Bazar is like a social network. Each company has its profile, look for companies that may be interested in their products or that provide with reliability at better prices.</p>

        <p>Unlike a social network Bazar is aimed at businesses and business groups and associations. It is free software programmed in Ruby, has a distributed structure and serves to generate market</p>"
